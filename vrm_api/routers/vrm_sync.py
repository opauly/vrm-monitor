"""
`vrm_api`'s router for pulling directly from Victron's VRM cloud
(PLAN_PHASE15.md §0.4 — `vrm_link.py`'s deliberate sibling: that router
stores the credential and the site mapping, this one uses them).

`POST /v1/vrm-sync` creates a `vrm_sync` job (migration 024 added the kind)
and runs it through the exact same in-process `BackgroundTasks` model
`routers/ingest.py` already uses (`jobs.create_job` / `jobs.run_job`) — no
new job machinery. Unlike ingest, there is no preview/commit split
(PLAN_PHASE15.md §6.1): a sync is idempotent and cheap to repeat, with no
uploaded artifact to parse exactly once, so a preview step would be pure
ceremony — the connect flow's validate-then-connect is this phase's
equivalent "never write on the first click" guarantee, for the part that
actually matters (the token).

── Tenancy — the third control (PLAN_PHASE15.md §3.2) ──────────────────────
`tenancy.assert_owns_site(customer_id, site_id)` is not a formality here —
it IS the enforcement point for "customer A's token can never pull customer
B's data even if a site_id gets confused somewhere". The site row it returns
is the ONLY source of `vrm_installation_id` this module ever calls Victron
with. `schemas.VrmSyncRequest` has no field that could carry an installation
id from a request body — grep it; there is nothing to grep. As a second,
independent backstop (in case our own site<->installation mapping is simply
wrong, not tampered with), `_do_sync()` compares the installation id Victron
actually returned data for against the one the site row said to call, and
aborts — writing nothing — on any mismatch (§3.2 control 3).

── Token handling (PLAN_PHASE15.md §2.5 rule 4) ────────────────────────────
`vrm.jobs.params` is exactly `{customer_id, site_id, start, end}` — built by
hand in `post_sync()` below, never `body.model_dump()` (unlike every other
job in this API, which does exactly that — this is the one place that
pattern must NOT be copied, because `VrmSyncRequest` has no token field to
accidentally include, but a future body that grew one would silently leak
through a `model_dump()`). The token itself is read fresh, per run, inside
`_do_sync()` via `vrm_api.secrets.read_customer_vrm_token()` — never cached,
never passed into `jobs.create_job()`, never returned in a job's `result`.

── Failure handling (PLAN_PHASE15.md §9 — the authoritative table this
   module implements row by row) ────────────────────────────────────────────
  * 401/403 (`VrmRemoteAuthError`) — stamps `vrm.customers.
    vrm_token_revoked_at`/`vrm_token_last_checked_at`/`vrm_token_last_error`.
    "Disable further syncs for that customer" is achieved WITHOUT a separate
    flag check: `vrm_api.secrets.read_customer_vrm_token()`'s own wrapper
    function already returns `NULL` once `vrm_token_revoked_at` is set
    (migration 024), so the very next sync attempt for this customer sees
    "no live token" and fails cleanly before ever calling Victron again —
    the revocation stamp IS the disable mechanism, not an additional one.
  * 429 (`VrmRemoteRateLimited`) — job fails with a retry message; NO
    `vrm.customers` token-state column is touched (§9: "token state
    untouched" — read literally here as "none of vrm_token_revoked_at/
    _last_checked_at/_last_ok_at/_last_error change").
  * Victron down / network (`VrmRemoteUnavailable`,
    `VrmRemoteBudgetExceeded`) — job fails; `vrm.sites.vrm_last_sync_error`
    is stamped; token state untouched, same reasoning as 429.
  * Installation missing / no longer shared (`VrmRemoteNotFound`) —
    `vrm.sites.vrm_last_sync_error='installation_not_found'` AND
    `vrm_sync_enabled=false`. §9's table is explicit about both — this is
    the literal table text, not the shorter "token untouched" paraphrase in
    PLAN_PHASE15.md §8 Step 4's build bullet, which doesn't mention
    `vrm_sync_enabled` either way; the table (§9) is the authoritative
    spec and is followed here. `vrm_installation_id` itself is left alone
    (unlinking-and-remapping is a customer/admin action, not this job's).
  * Installation id mismatch (§3.2 control 3) — job fails, nothing written,
    and it is logged at `CRITICAL` (not `WARNING`) specifically BECAUSE §9
    says this one means something is wrong with OUR OWN mapping, not
    Victron's data — the one failure mode in this table Oscar should
    actually go looking for.

── Step 4b addition: an optional admin-sourced token (PLAN_PHASE15.md §3.3) ─
`_do_sync()` gained an optional `token` keyword argument after this module
was first built and independently verified. `routers/vrm_fleet.py` (Oscar's
own VRM fleet, `VRM_ADMIN_TOKEN`) is the only caller that ever passes a real
value; every call site in THIS file (`post_sync()`, `post_run_due()`) still
passes nothing and gets the exact original Vault-read behaviour described
above, unchanged. See `_do_sync()`'s own docstring for why every place this
function touches `vrm.customers`' token-STATE columns is gated on
`token is None` (`is_customer_token`) — those columns describe a customer's
own connection, and must never be stamped from an admin-token call.

# in the health-score query that surfaces it (`fleetOverviewCore.ts` — its
# own "skip Partial day rows" logic is correct and already documented; it
# was just never being fed a complete day to find). `start` used to be
# derived from `vrm_last_synced_at`'s DATE, and that stamp is written as
# `_now()` — today's date — the moment a run finishes, not the date it
# actually finished covering. So the very next calendar day, `start` was
# already >= that day's own `yesterday`, and the site was marked
# "skipped_up_to_date" forever after syncing a given date exactly once —
# even though Victron's own device→cloud backfill for that date may not
# have finished landing yet at the moment it was first (and, under the old
# logic, ONLY ever) fetched. Confirmed live: every recent day for every
# site showed the same ~18-21h-of-24h "Partial day" coverage, never
# revisited. `_RECENT_REFRESH_DAYS` below re-covers a small trailing
