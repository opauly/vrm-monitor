"""
`vrm_api`'s router for linking to Victron's VRM cloud (PLAN_PHASE15.md §0.4:
this file's name says exactly what it is — our API's router for linking to
Victron's — deliberately distinct from `vrm_api` itself, which is what this
whole service is called).

Three deliberate steps, none of which stores anything until the last
(PLAN_PHASE15.md §3.1):

  1. `POST /validate` — Victron `GET /users/me` + `GET /users/{id}/installations`
     with the pasted token. Writes NOTHING to Postgres or Vault. Lets the
     customer see *their own real installation names* before committing to
     anything.
  2. (client-side only) the customer maps each returned installation to
     "ignore" (simply omit it), "link to an existing site", or "create a new
     site" — mirrored here by `VrmLinkMapping.site_name_or_id`, the exact
     same ambiguous-by-design field `IngestPreviewRequest` already uses
     (`tenancy.find_customer_site()` decides which case it is — see
     `routers/ingest.py`). Reused deliberately rather than inventing a
     second way to express the same "existing site, or this string is a new
     site's name" ambiguity.
  3. `POST /connect` — re-validates the token (the customer may have taken
     minutes to map), then and only then writes: the Vault-backed token
     (`vrm_api/secrets.py`), the customer's `vrm_user_id`/
     `vrm_account_email`, and each mapping's `vrm_installation_id`/
     `source='vrm_api'`/`vrm_sync_enabled=true` on its target site (created
     via `victron.ingest.upsert_site()` if new, exactly like
     `routers/ingest.py`'s commit flow does for a new CSV-uploaded site).

`POST /disconnect` destroys the credential (via `vrm_api.secrets.
clear_customer_vrm_token()`, which stamps `vrm_token_revoked_at` and
actually deletes the Vault secret — Step 1's job, not reimplemented here)
and reverts every `source='vrm_api'` site of this customer's back to
`source='csv_upload'`/`vrm_sync_enabled=false`. It never deletes
`energy_daily`/`alarm_events`/`daily_health` history (PLAN_PHASE15.md §3.1:
"disconnecting a credential must not delete a year of a customer's
history").

`GET /status` returns connection STATE only — never a token, not even a
hint of one (PLAN_PHASE15.md §2.5 rule 2, the rule this endpoint exists
closest to violating by accident: its response model
(`schemas.VrmLinkStatusOut`) simply has no field a token could travel
through).

── Tenancy (PLAN_PHASE15.md §3.2) ──────────────────────────────────────────
Every handler below calls `tenancy.get_customer(body.customer_id)` first.
A mapping's target site is tenancy-checked by construction: an *existing*
site can only be found by `tenancy.find_customer_site()`, which is scoped to
`customer_id` from the start (the same guarantee `routers/ingest.py`'s
preview flow relies on for exactly the same reason) — there is no code path
here that can write to a site belonging to a different customer.

── Token handling ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`body.token` lives in this module for exactly as long as one request/
job-scheduling call takes, is never logged, and is only ever passed to
`victron.vrm_remote.VrmRemoteClient` (which itself never logs it — see that
module's own docstring) or to `vrm_api.secrets.set_customer_vrm_token()`
(which stores it in Vault and never returns it). No response model in
`vrm_api/schemas.py` for this router has a field that could carry a token
back out.
