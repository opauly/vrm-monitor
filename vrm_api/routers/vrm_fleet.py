"""
`vrm_api`'s router for Oscar's OWN VRM fleet — a second, parallel token
model to `vrm_link.py`'s customer self-serve one (PLAN_PHASE15.md §3.3).

`vrm_link.py`/`vrm_sync.py` answer "can a customer connect and pull their
own VRM account." This router answers a different question: "can Oscar keep
his existing install-everything-himself workflow (the same role CSV upload
already plays, `pages/06_vrm_monitor.py`'s 'Cargar' tab / the Next.js
`/admin` panel), just pulling from Victron's VRM cloud instead of a CSV
file." Both ship; neither replaces the other (§3.3).

── Why this is safe without reopening §0.5 Q6 ("no, admin does not paste a
   customer's token") ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§0.5 Q6 was about Oscar becoming custodian of a CUSTOMER'S OWN credential —
a liability transfer. This is different: it is Oscar's OWN token, which he
already holds, read the same way every other platform-wide credential in
this product is (`os.environ["VRM_ADMIN_TOKEN"]`, alongside
`PIPELINE_API_KEY`/`RESEND_API_KEY`) — never a `vrm.customers`/Vault-backed
per-tenant secret, because there is exactly one of these, not one per
customer. No customer's credential is ever touched by this module.

── Storage — a platform secret, not a Vault-per-customer one (§3.3) ────────
`VRM_ADMIN_TOKEN` lives in the shared root `.env`, read via `os.environ`
exactly like every other credential `vrm_api` reads through
`database.supabase_client`'s bare `load_dotenv()` — there is no separate
`vrm_api/.env` file (checked before writing this module; see §3.3's own
"corrected 2026-08-18" note). Never logged, never returned from an endpoint,
never written into `vrm.jobs.params` (`post_sync()` below builds `params` by
hand, the same discipline `vrm_sync.py:post_sync()` already uses for the
customer path — see that module's own docstring).

── Authorization — admin-role check only, and it is Next.js's job, not
   this router's (§3.3, coder correction) ──────────────────────────────────
This router carries the exact same `dependencies=[Depends(require_pipeline_key)]`
every other `vrm_api` router already has, and NOTHING MORE. There is no
`assertOwnsSite()`/per-role check inside `vrm_api` itself for this flow — by
design: there is no single owning "requesting customer" to check a `site_id`
against (a fleet sync's site could belong to any customer). The actual
"is this an admin" gate is entirely Next.js's `requireAdmin()`/
`requireAdminForRoute()` (`lib/server/auth.ts`), which every route under
`app/(admin)/admin/vrm-fleet/` and `app/api/admin/pipeline/vrm-fleet/*`
calls as its first statement — the same proven pattern every existing
`/admin/*` page and `app/api/admin/pipeline/*` route already uses (e.g.
`app/(admin)/admin/upload/`). A non-admin session never reaches this router
at all; it never gets far enough to matter that this router itself has no
opinion on roles.

── The one legitimate `upsert_customer()` call site in `vrm_api` ───────────
`routers/ingest.py:_do_commit()`'s own docstring explains why a
customer-initiated request must never create/rename a tenant
(PLAN_PHASE14.md §1.12 rule 1) and leaves a TODO for "an admin-initiated
upload." `post_link()` below is that admin-only path, for THIS flow: there
is no self-serve customer session here whose tenant-creation authority needs
protecting — the entire router is only reachable via an admin fleet-browse
UI. `victron.ingest.upsert_customer()`/`upsert_site()` (create-or-reuse by
slug/site_id, exactly as `pages/06_vrm_monitor.py`'s own manual site form
and `tab_upload()`'s CSV path already use) are called directly, matching
`/admin/customers`' own tenant-creation authority on the Next.js side.

    row: this is a short, bounded, per-site loop (like `vrm_sync.py:
    post_run_due()`), not a long single-site render worth its own job
    record.

    Token per site, not one token for everything: a customer-connected
    site should be read with THAT CUSTOMER's own VRM credential (the same
    one `vrm_sync.py:post_sync()`'s "Sync now" already reads) — correct
    scoping, and it works even for an installation `VRM_ADMIN_TOKEN` was
    never granted to see. `VRM_ADMIN_TOKEN` is the fallback, for a site
    that only exists because it was linked through THIS router's own admin
    fleet flow, which never collects a customer token at all (`post_sync()`
    above always passes `token=VRM_ADMIN_TOKEN` explicitly, for the same
    reason). A site with neither is skipped, not failed — there is
    genuinely nothing to fetch it with.

    One site's failure never stops the sweep — same per-site isolation
    `vrm_sync.py:post_run_due()` already uses for exactly this reason.

    Live alarm/critical-alert state added 2026-09-01 (see
    `victron/vrm_live.py`'s module docstring for why): `fetch_live_snapshot()`
    below now folds each category's current state directly into this same
    snapshot row (`raw.alarms`/`raw.critical_alerts`) — a plain "is this
    present right now" read, not an episode/history record. The historical
    sync still owns `vrm.alarm_events`/`vrm.critical_alerts` for report/
    health-score purposes, untouched by this.

    Phase 3b, PLAN_PHASE19_FLEET_P3.md §3 — see `victron/anomaly_silence.py`'s
    own module docstring for the full check). Same "reuse data this sweep
    already fetched, zero extra VRM API cost" reasoning as the live-alarm
    work above; this one is DB-only (no VRM call of its own), it just needs
    each site's PREVIOUS `site_snapshots` reading (for the 2-consecutive-
    check debounce) fetched BEFORE this loop's own upserts overwrite it, and
    each site's recent `vrm.energy_daily` rows (for the "should be
    producing" gate) — both batched in ONE query each for the whole sweep,
    not per-site, same "one query for the whole page, not N+1" discipline
    `_monitoring_suggestions_by_installation()` already uses above.

    """Fleet Dashboard Phase 3a ("quiet drift") + Phase 3c ("underperformance
    vs. design") + Phase 3d ("incomplete charging") anomaly detection —
    3a/3c added 2026-09-03 (PLAN_PHASE19_FLEET_P3.md §4/§5 — see
    `victron/anomaly_drift.py`'s own module docstring for the full checks),
    3d added the same day once those three were live (see
    `victron/anomaly_battery.py`'s own module docstring — needs no PVGIS/
    coordinates at all, unlike 3a/3c, so it runs for every site regardless
    of the lat/lon gate below). Sibling of `post_refresh_snapshots()` above
    (same per-site isolation, same "one query for the whole sweep, not N+1"
    batching of `vrm.energy_daily`), but NOT hooked into that ~15-minute
    live sweep — all three read `vrm.
    energy_daily`, which is daily-grain and only actually advances once per
    site per day (via `vrm_sync.py:post_run_due()`'s own due-ness gate), so
    running this on the same 15-minute cadence would just recompute an
    identical result ~96 times a day for nothing.

    Meant to be called once daily, piggybacking on the existing daily sync
    cadence per PLAN_PHASE19_FLEET_P3.md §4 point 4 / §5 ("same cadence as
    3a") — wired into `.github/workflows/scheduled-reports.yml`, right after
    that workflow's own "Sync due VRM-API sites" step, the same job that
    already keeps `vrm.energy_daily` current. That workflow's own cron is
    hourly, not daily (§0 of that file's own comment explains why: coarser
    per-site local-hour scheduling doesn't mean anything at daily
    granularity) — calling this endpoint on every one of those hourly ticks
    is harmless, not wasteful in any way that matters: `vrm.energy_daily`
    itself only changes once a day per site (same due-ness gate above), so
    every call before that day's sync lands just recomputes the same
    result idempotently, and each check's own Supabase read/write cost is
    trivial next to a VRM API call. This is a real, deliberate choice, not
    an oversight — building a literal once-daily-only trigger would need
    this workflow to track its own last-run date somewhere, additional
    state for no behavioral gain over "safe to call more often than it
    needs to matter."

    One site's failure never stops the sweep — same per-site isolation
    `post_refresh_snapshots()` above and `vrm_sync.py:post_run_due()` both
    already use for exactly this reason.
