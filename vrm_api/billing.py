"""
The domain layer for ONVO billing (PLAN_PHASE16.md §0.3, §4, §8 Step 2). All
the judgement in this phase lives here — `vrm_api/onvo.py` is transport
only, and nothing outside this module ever writes `vrm.customers.plan`,
`site_limit`, `billing_status`, or `provisioning_state` (the third writer
being `lib/server/db/admin.ts`, on the Next.js side, unchanged by this
phase — PLAN_PHASE16.md §0.1/§11).

Two functions, exactly the shape §4 designs:

  `reconcile_customer(customer_id)` — the ONLY code that writes the mirror
  tables (`vrm.billing_customers`, `vrm.subscriptions`,
  `vrm.subscription_invoices`). Read-through, not event-sourced (§0.5): it
  never applies a webhook payload, never trusts its own previous write,
  always re-reads ONVO with the secret key and overwrites the mirror
  wholesale. Every mutation this product performs elsewhere (Step 3's
  subscribe/cancel/change endpoints) is required to end by calling this —
  see §11's "never parse our own POST's response into state."

  `apply_entitlements(customer_id)` — the only path from money to
  `plan`/`site_limit`/`billing_status`/`provisioning_state`, called only
  from `reconcile_customer()` (§4.5). It never talks to ONVO directly; it
  only reads what `reconcile_customer()` just wrote to the mirror.

── The concurrency guard (§4.3 rule 6) ─────────────────────────────────────
Every mirror upsert here is conditional on `last_synced_at < fetched_at`
(`fetched_at` stamped once, before this reconcile's first ONVO call —
`_conditional_upsert()`'s docstring has the mechanics). Two concurrent
`reconcile_customer()` calls therefore resolve to whichever one READ later,
never whichever one WROTE last — the only ordering rule this system needs,
and one that depends on nothing inside ONVO's own (unordered, un-timestamped
— §0.2b finding 9) payloads.

── Status → entitlement mapping (§4.5 rule 2, filled in from §0.2b finding
   4's closed 7-value vocabulary) ───────────────────────────────────────
See `_STATUS_ENTITLEMENT` below. `past_due` counts as entitled (Q8's 7-day
grace policy — implemented by simply treating the status as entitled while
it lasts; ONVO's own dunning cycle is what eventually moves it to `active`
or a terminal state, this module does not run a separate timer). Any status
NOT in the map is unrecognized (ONVO added a value with no notice) and HOLDS
current entitlement rather than dropping it — §4.5 rule 2's own reasoning:
over-granting for a day is a far smaller failure than locking a paying
customer out of their own data over a third party's enum change.

── Entitled status is necessary but NOT sufficient — the payment-method gap
   (fixed here, live-validation finding, 2026-08-20) ────────────────────
`routers/billing.py:post_subscription()` creates the ONVO subscription with
`paymentBehavior: allow_incomplete`, `trialPeriodDays: 7`, and **no**
`paymentMethodId` — and §0.2b finding 11, re-confirmed live while building
this fix, means ONVO reports that subscription as `status: "trialing"`
**immediately**, before any card is ever collected. §0.6 Q2's decision
("card required upfront") is a product intent, not something ONVO's
`status` field enforces on our behalf. A caller who calls `POST
/v1/billing/subscription` and then `POST /v1/billing/refresh` directly
(skipping the SDK widget's card-entry step entirely) would otherwise walk
straight into `_STATUS_ENTITLEMENT["trialing"] == True` and be granted a
full trial with no card ever collected. `apply_entitlements()` below
therefore treats "status is entitled-shaped" as necessary but not
sufficient: it additionally requires `vrm.billing_customers.
default_payment_method_id` to be non-null for this customer before
granting/promoting. If the status is entitled-shaped but there is no
payment method on file, this is folded into the SAME `'hold'` branch
`_classify_status()` already uses for an unrecognized status — do not
grant, do not promote, log loudly (`billing.entitled_status_no_payment_
method`) — because the reasoning is identical: an ambiguous "should we
grant?" state is safer held than guessed. This covers both a signup still
mid-flow (waiting for the SDK step) and a payment method detached after
the fact (an admin/ONVO-dashboard action — not exposed to customers, §5.3);
in the latter case ONVO's own dunning cycle naturally moves `status` off an
entitled value on the next failed renewal attempt, and ordinary
classification takes it from there.
