"""
Job bookkeeping against `vrm.jobs` (migration 023) — create/run/poll, plus
the startup sweep for jobs orphaned by a restart. PLAN_PHASE14.md §1.6.

Execution model: a route handler creates a `queued` row synchronously (one
insert — fast), then schedules `run_job` via FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`.
Starlette runs a *sync* background task through `anyio.to_thread` — its
bounded worker thread pool — automatically; nothing here spins up its own
executor. That is the whole of "in-process, bounded thread pool, not Celery/
Redis" (§1.6): the concurrency control already exists in the framework, so
adding a second one would just be two pools to reason about instead of one.

The trade this buys: a container restart silently drops any job that was
mid-flight. There is no queue to persist it and re-pick it up. `sweep_stale_jobs()`
is the honest acknowledgment of that cost, not a fix for it — it turns
"stuck in `running` forever" into "clearly `failed`, please retry," which is
the best a process with no state outside one Postgres row can promise.
