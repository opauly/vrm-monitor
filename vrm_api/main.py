FastAPI entry point for `vrm_api` — the internal pipeline service
`victron-monitor/web`'s server calls to run VRM CSV ingestion and render
weekly/overview reports, without rewriting `victron/vrm_csv.py`,
`victron/ingest.py`, or `victron/weekly_report.py` (PLAN_PHASE14.md §1.3,
§2 Step 5).

── No CORS middleware — anywhere, ever (PLAN_PHASE14.md §1.3) ─────────────
This is not "CORS configured to deny everything"; it is CORS not configured
at all. `victron-monitor/web`'s server is the only legitimate *browser-facing*
caller, and a server never runs in a browser's CORS sandbox to begin with —
it doesn't need permission. Installing `CORSMiddleware` with an empty/strict
allow-list would still add an `Access-Control-*` response path that a future
edit could loosen by one line without anyone noticing it changed the trust
boundary. With no middleware installed, Starlette has nothing to answer a
browser's `OPTIONS` preflight with (no route here declares `OPTIONS`, so it
405s, and no response anywhere carries `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) — a
browser fails the preflight by construction, not by policy. `routers/
public_tariffs.py` (below) is called server-side by an external tool, not
from a browser tab, so this still holds for it — if that ever changes, this
paragraph is the thing to revisit before adding CORS.

── Every route but /health requires a bearer token (vrm_api/deps.py) ──────
Wired as a `dependencies=[Depends(require_pipeline_key)]` on each router
in `routers/`, not globally on `app` — `GET /health` is registered directly
here with no dependency, because it is the one endpoint PLAN_PHASE14.md §1.3
carves out as unauthenticated (so an uptime monitor / Render's own health
check can hit it without holding the pipeline key).

── `routers/public_tariffs.py` — the one deliberate second caller ─────────
Everything above describes a service built for exactly one caller
(`victron-monitor/web`'s server). `public_tariffs` is a scoped, read-only
exception: an external tool (Claude Design) needs live ARESEP tariff rates
for maintenance-report savings tables, and hand-copying tier numbers into a
text box each time both doesn't scale and silently goes stale whenever
ARESEP revises a rate. It is gated by its own key
(`require_public_tariff_key`, a separate secret from `PIPELINE_API_KEY`) and
touches only public utility-rate data — never a customer, a site, or this
project's own metering data — so it doesn't reopen the trust boundary the
rest of this file protects.
