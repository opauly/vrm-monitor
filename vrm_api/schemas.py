Pydantic request/response models for `vrm_api`'s HTTP surface.

`SiteFieldsIn` is the one model worth reading closely: it is this API's half
of PLAN_PHASE14.md §1.2 rule 4's "typed field whitelists, enforced twice."
`victron-monitor/web/lib/server/db/sites.ts` already whitelists what a
customer-facing request may set on a site; this model re-states the same
whitelist on the API side, with `extra="forbid"`, because `site_fields` is
the one place in this API's request bodies that reaches an
`upsert_site(customer_id, site_id, display_name, **fields)`-shaped
passthrough (`victron/ingest.py`) — without a whitelist here, a bug (not
even malice) two calls upstream in Next.js could put `customer_id` or
`battery_usable_kwh` into that dict and this API would forward it unchanged.
