// changing this one; the role-resolution *order* below is a deliberate,
// exact port, not a reinterpretation.
//
// ── Why this looks different in shape from the Python original ──────────
// `vrm_portal/auth.py` resolves a role once, at sign-in, and caches the
// result in `st.session_state` for the rest of that browser tab's life
// (Phase 13 §1.10 — sessions didn't survive a refresh anyway, so caching
// cost nothing extra). There is no server-side equivalent of
// `st.session_state` here: every request is its own render, so
// `getSessionContext()` re-derives role + `customerId` from Supabase on
// every call. That is intentional, not a missed optimization — it is what
// makes `requireCustomer()` / `requireAdmin()` "the first statement of
// every route handler, server action, and protected page" (§1.2 rule 4) an
// actually-enforced property instead of a stale cached one: if Oscar
// deactivates a customer mid-session, the very next guarded request sees it.
