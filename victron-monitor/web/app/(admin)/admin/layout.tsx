// First statement of the layout — see the matching comment in
// app/(portal)/app/layout.tsx; same reasoning, admin side.
//
// Nav labels are inline English literals, not `lib/i18n/strings.ts` keys —
// admin views were originally Spanish by explicit product decision
// (PLAN_PHASE14.md §1.10 / PLAN_PHASE13.md §0.3 Q2), ported near-verbatim
// from `pages/06_vrm_monitor.py`'s own tab names ("Sitios", "Cargar CSV",
// "Reporte"); that decision was reversed 2026-08-19 ("now let's use English
// only across all account types") and every admin string was translated in
// place. Routes below don't exist until Step 7 (customers/sites) or
// Step 5-7 (upload/reports/activity) and 404 until then — same precedent
// as Nav's "Log in" link in Step 2 and AppShell's own /app links here.

  // "VRM Fleet" is `personal: true` (2026-08-19, Oscar's own request) — the
  // one tab here that isn't subscriber data: every other route reads/writes
  // `vrm.customers`/`vrm.sites` scoped to a `customer_id`, while VRM Fleet
  // is Oscar's own VRM account, unrelated to any subscriber until he
  // explicitly links an installation to one. `AppShell` renders it in a
  // separated, highlighted group so that distinction is visible, not just
  // documented here.
  //
  // Merged 2026-08-31 (Oscar's own request — two tabs over the same site
  // set was confusing): "Fleet Health" and "VRM Fleet" used to be separate
  // top-level tabs, one for monitoring already-linked sites and one for
  // linking new ones. Now there is one nav entry, landing on the live
  // dashboard (`/admin/fleet`) — linking a new installation is still
  // `/admin/vrm-fleet`, reached via a "Manage installations" link on that
  // dashboard rather than its own top-level tab.
