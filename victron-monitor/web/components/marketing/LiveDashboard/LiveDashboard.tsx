// The dashboard existed on this page only as a single bullet inside
// Pricing's Growth card — everything else was written when reports were
// the only product. This section (2026-09-04) gives it the same
// text-column + Panel-readout treatment ReportPreview gives the report,
// placed right before Pricing since that's where the Growth/Fleet-only
// gate actually matters.
//
// The 4 AI Insight names/descriptions below are copied verbatim from the
// real in-app copy (`app/(portal)/app/dashboard/page.tsx`'s rollup-card
// `desc` text, `lib/i18n/strings.ts`'s `dashboard_anomaly_*` keys) — this
// page and the product must never describe the same feature two different
// ways. The readout panel's numbers are illustrative, same honesty
// convention as Hero's own `Readout` ("SAMPLE SITE" label, not a real
// customer) — there's no real `/app/dashboard` screenshot to show, and a
// public marketing page is the wrong place for real-looking customer data
// even if synthetic.
