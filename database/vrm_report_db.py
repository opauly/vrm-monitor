Schema-agnostic reader for the Victron weekly report.

Ports Apps Script's `fetchSiteRow_` / `fetchEnergyDailyRows_` /
`fetchDailyHealthRows_` / `fetchLongestOutageMinutes_`
(`victron-monitor/apps-script/Victron_Events_App_Script_v1p7.js` ~lines
1634-1750) into Python, with one addition: every function takes a `schema`.

`monitoring` holds Pauly & Co's own Cerbo GX sites, written by Node-RED.
`vrm` holds external customers' sites, written from VRM CSV exports. The two
have the same table and column shape by design, so the report reads either
through this one module. That's the whole bet: one reader, one set of KPI
definitions, instead of a Python copy that drifts from the Apps Script
original — which is exactly what went wrong in the Sheets-to-Supabase
migration (see CONTEXT.md).

Everything here is read-only. Ingestion writes live in `victron/`.

    never been scored or counted anywhere else in this product.

    arriving while the first is still active does not open a new counted
    episode there. This function, querying `alarm_events` directly per

    first draft of this feature assumed it was and shipped `alarmEpisodesTotal`

    serves both without the trend needing special-cased logic.

    Each bucket: `{label, start, end, days, pv, load, grid, discharge,
    min_soc, max_soc}`. `days` counts how many of the bucket's calendar days
