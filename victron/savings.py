"""
Estimated savings for the weekly report — replaces the "Tariff data coming
soon" placeholder with a real number, without ever asking which electric
company a site is on.

Two paths, chosen automatically from `sites.country` (already a column on
both `monitoring.sites` and `vrm.sites`, default 'CR'):

- **country == 'CR'**: runs the real ARESEP tiered bill formula
  (`victron/vrm_shared/tariff_calculator.py`, forked from
  `calculations/tariff_calculator.py` — same engine the Grid Zero
  proposal calculator uses) — blended across every seeded Costa Rica
  distributor's T-RE tariff into one effective ₡/kWh
  (`estimate_blended_effective_rate_crc`). This covers `monitoring` (Pauly &
  Co's own fleet, currently 100% Costa Rica) and any `vrm` site the operator
  hasn't marked otherwise, with zero configuration.
- **country != 'CR'**: uses `sites.savings_rate` / `savings_currency` — a
  flat rate the operator typed in at CSV upload (migration 014, `vrm.sites`
  only). If unset, savings are not shown. Never fabricated.

In both paths, savings = avoided grid purchase only:
`(load − grid import) × rate`. Exported energy is deliberately NOT counted —
export compensation (net metering vs net billing vs none at all) is a policy
variable that differs by country and even by Costa Rican distributor;
modeling it without knowing the specific policy risks a confidently wrong
number, which is worse than the honest gap this leaves for exporting sites.

`rate` itself is energy charge ÷ kWh only — see
`victron/vrm_shared/tariff_calculator.py`'s own docstring for why bomberos,
alumbrado público, IVA, and Generación Distribuida charges are excluded
from that formula entirely, not just from this weekly-report path.
