"""
Format-independent daily-summary core, shared by every Victron ingestion path.

Extracted from `victron/vrm_csv.py` (PLAN_PHASE15.md §4.1/§4.2) without any
behaviour change: everything here operates on the *tidied* frame's canonical
columns (`pv_w`, `load_w`, `grid_import_w`, `grid_v_l1`, `soc_pct`, `batt_v`,
`batt_temp_c`, ...) or on an already-extracted boolean/series input, never on
a CSV column name. `vrm_csv.py` — the export-file mapper — is this module's
first caller, and keeps its own public signatures unchanged, delegating into
the functions below. A future cloud-API mapper (`vrm_series.py`, not built by
this step) is the second caller; it will build the same canonical columns
from Victron VRM cloud time series instead of a CSV export, then reuse this
module's outage detector, integrator, and daily-row builder as-is.

Three traps this module exists to keep fixed in one place rather than
re-learned per ingestion path (see `vrm_csv.py`'s own docstring for the full
story of how each was found):

1. **Outages are AC-input voltage absence, not inverter state and not
   `Grid alarm`.** See `_grid_outages()`.
2. **An all-NaN sample must let the previous state persist, not reset it.**
   See `_grid_outages()`.
3. **A day's fine-grained sample spacing is real, not assumed** — `integrate()`
   and `_grid_outages()` both derive elapsed time from the index itself, and
   both refuse to integrate/count across a gap wider than `max_gap_s`.

`max_gap_s` is deliberately never given a module-level default here (contrast
`vrm_csv.MAX_GAP_S = 300`, which is that path's own choice). Every function
below that needs it takes it as an explicit, required argument. This is not
stylistic: `integrate()`'s existing 300s default was tuned for the CSV path's
~1-minute sampling. Reusing that default unexamined against a `15mins`-interval
API series (900s between samples) would treat *every single gap* as "too
large to integrate" and silently return ~0 kWh for every day — see
PLAN_PHASE15.md §4.3. Requiring the caller to pass `max_gap_s` explicitly is
what forces that decision to be made deliberately, per ingestion path.

    `Grid alarm` is NOT usable for this, despite being the signal Node-RED
    reads. It is flat (`Grid ok`) across every export checked — 9 sites x ~161
    days — including stretches where the AC input sits at 0.00 V for hours
    while the battery carries the load. Read literally it reports zero outages
    forever, which is what the weekly report was showing for sites that in fact
    lose grid 4-12 times a month.

    Voltage absence is the reliable signal, and it cross-validates: sibling
    sites on one feeder (the three Vista Atenas meters; the Rebeca Ruiz
    cluster) show identical outage timestamps to the second, while an event
    local to a single site appears only there.

    Two traps this function exists to avoid, both of which produce
    plausible-looking wrong numbers rather than errors:

    1. **VRM emits an all-NaN row at each exact hour boundary.** Treating "no
       reading" as "grid present" ends the run there, chopping one outage into
       59.9-minute pieces — one 33-hour event became 33 hourly ones. NaN rows
       therefore inherit the previous known state rather than clearing it.
    2. **Duration is summed from real sample spacing, clipped at `max_gap_s`**,
       not taken as end-minus-start. A logging hole inside an outage would
       otherwise be counted as outage time, inflating it without evidence. The
       gap leading into the first absent sample is included, so an outage is
       measured from the last moment the grid was known good.

    Takes the tidied frame (not `raw`): voltage is normalised to numeric there,
    and phase 2 is absent on single-phase sites. `max_gap_s` is required, not
    defaulted — see the module docstring.
