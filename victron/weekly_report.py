"""
Weekly monitoring report — Python port of Apps Script's `weeklyReport(siteId)`
(`victron-monitor/apps-script/Victron_Events_App_Script_v1p7.js` lines 684-1006).

Reads through `database/vrm_report_db.py`, so it renders from either the
`monitoring` schema (Cerbo GX sites written by Node-RED) or `vrm` (external
customers' sites ingested from VRM CSV exports).

Calibrated against a real sent report,
`Weekly Report - Vista Atenas LP M3 - 2026-07-27.pdf`.

Two intentional differences from the original, both agreed before the port:

1. **True 7-day window.** The original computes `start = today - 7` with both
   bounds inclusive — an 8-day query. In practice it returned 7 rows because
   the final day's row does not exist yet when the Monday trigger runs, so the
   header printed a period one day longer than the data it summarised. Here
   the window is 7 days and the header reports the period actually covered.
2. **`system_type` conditionals are applied.** Grid blocks are dropped for
   `off_grid`, battery blocks for `grid_zero`, rather than rendering cards that
   have no meaning for that system. The original carries `TODO(system_type)`
   markers at the three places this would have required recomputing hardcoded
   SVG column offsets.
