Fleet Dashboard Phase 3a ("quiet drift") + Phase 3c ("underperformance vs.
design") anomaly detection (2026-09-03, PLAN_PHASE19_FLEET_P3.md §4/§5).

Sibling of `victron/anomaly_silence.py` (3b, already shipped) — same
`vrm.site_anomalies` table (migration 038, whose `anomaly_type` CHECK
constraint already includes `'quiet_drift'`/`'underperformance'`, no new
migration needed), same "one open row per (site_id, anomaly_type)" shape,
same deterministic/no-ML posture. Different cadence: 3b runs on the
~15-minute live-snapshot sweep (`vrm_fleet.py:post_refresh_snapshots()`); 3a
and 3c are DAILY checks (they read `vrm.energy_daily`, which is itself only
daily-grain and only advances once per site per day) — both are called from
`vrm_fleet.py:post_detect_anomalies_daily()`, hooked into the existing
`scheduled-reports.yml` hourly cron (piggybacking the same job that already
keeps `vrm.energy_daily` current via `vrm_sync.py:post_run_due()`, rather
than inventing a new schedule — PLAN_PHASE19_FLEET_P3.md §4 point 4 / §5's
own "same cadence as 3a" instruction).

── A shared PR-computation core, per the plan's own instruction ───────────
§4/§5 both say: "write one utility function, parameterize... rather than
duplicating the PVGIS plumbing twice." `_site_monthly_shape()` +
`_build_daily_series()` below are that shared core — both read
`victron.vrm_shared.pvgis.fetch_irradiance()` (forked from
`calculations/pvgis.py`; per-site MONTHLY kWh/kWp, a
multi-year climatological average, Supabase-cached by lat/lon) and turn it
into a per-calendar-day "expected shape" any site's real `pv_kwh` history
can be compared against. The two checks below differ only in HOW they use
that shape:
  * `check_quiet_drift()` (3a) — self-baseline mode. No `pv_kwp` needed:
    each day's real `pv_kwh` is deseasonalized by PVGIS's own *relative*
    shape (that calendar month's average daily expected kWh/kWp / the
    site's own annual average daily kWh/kWp), producing an "as if every day
    had average irradiance" output series, then a 14-day recent window is
    compared to a ~90-day trailing baseline of that SAME series — a decline
    shows up as a real drop even though no absolute kWp conversion (and so
    no `pv_kwp`) was ever used. See `_build_daily_series()`'s `adjusted_kwh`
    field.
  * `check_underperformance()` (3c) — design-relative mode. Genuinely
    requires `pv_kwp` (no substitute exists for "what should this size of
    array produce" — §5): each day's real `pv_kwh` is compared directly to
    PVGIS's absolute expected kWh for that `pv_kwp` in that calendar month,
    producing a real day-level PR. See `_build_daily_series()`'s `pr` field
    (only populated when `pv_kwp` is passed in).

── Why MONTHLY shape, not `fetch_daily_series()`'s single reference year —
   a real bug found and fixed during THIS build, not a design choice made
   up front ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The first draft of this module matched each real calendar day against
`fetch_daily_series()`'s daily kWh/kWp for the SAME calendar date in ONE
specific historical PVGIS reference year (e.g. 2015) — the tool
`wizard/off_grid.py`'s battery-SoC simulation already uses, deliberately,
BECAUSE it preserves real day-to-day/cloudy-streak variability (see that
module's own docstring). That is exactly the wrong property for THIS use:
backtesting against real fleet data (rebeca-ruiz-el-encino-casona, this
build's own report has the numbers) surfaced day-level PR readings above
1.0 that traced directly to a single real day being compared against an
unusually CLOUDY day in the one arbitrary reference year PVGIS happened to
pick — noise from a DIFFERENT year's weather leaking into what should be a
smooth seasonal baseline, not a second source of real variance layered on
top of the fleet's own actual variance. `fetch_irradiance()`'s MONTHLY
kWh/kWp (a genuine multi-year climatological average, already the function
`docs/design-calibration-2026-08.md` §8 itself names as what Phase 11 used
for PR: "calculations/pvgis.py::fetch_irradiance — per-site monthly kWh/kWp
for PR") does not have this problem — every day in the same calendar month
gets that month's smoothed multi-year average, so all of the day-to-day
spread a real fleet site shows is real, not partly an artifact of which
single historical year PVGIS's daily series happened to use. Coarser
seasonal grain (12 buckets, not 365) is an accepted, already-precedented
trade-off here — `docs/design-calibration-2026-08.md` §6 open assumption 1
makes the same monthly-grain call for its own "seasonality is modelled, not
measured" caveat.

── Exclusion rules — Phase 11's, reused not reinvented ────────────────────
Both checks apply the exact same `vrm.energy_daily` row filter
`anomaly_silence.py:_site_productive_window()` already established for 3b:
drop a day with `pv_kwh IS NULL` (a day this pipeline has no real PV number
for at all) and drop a day with `complete_day = false` (a partial day — a
CSV-origin site mid-window, or a VRM sync that only covers part of a day).
That is `docs/design-calibration-2026-08.md` §8's own "drop partial days" /
"drop all-signal-null days" rule, applied the only way it is actually
computable from what `vrm.energy_daily` stores (a per-day `pv_kwh` total,
not an intraday signal) — the same posture `anomaly_silence.py`'s own module
docstring already explains for the identical constraint on 3b.

── Fail-closed posture, and how "insufficient data" differs from "clear" ──
PLAN_PHASE19_FLEET_P3.md §6: "<30 valid days produces no flag, not a
guessed one." Both checks below return immediately, doing nothing at all
(no insert, no clear, no update), the moment there isn't enough real history
to evaluate — same as `anomaly_silence.py`'s own `_site_productive_window()`
returning `None`. This is a deliberate asymmetry, mirroring 3b's own
precedent exactly: "not enough data" means "can't tell right now," which is
different from "checked, and the condition genuinely no longer holds" (which
DOES clear an open anomaly, see each function's own final branch). An
already-open anomaly is never silently cleared just because history became
temporarily unavailable/insufficient to re-derive (e.g. a sync gap) — it
stays open until a real, freshly-computed "no" outcome clears it, exactly
like 3b's "already open" branch skips its own window re-check entirely.

── Underperformance's "peak" — a real data-availability judgment call,
   flagged for Oscar, not silently resolved ─────────────────────────────
PLAN_PHASE19_FLEET_P3.md §5 asks 3c to compare "a site's best-recent-day
peak (or a smoothed recent max)" against PVGIS's expectation. `vrm.
energy_daily` is daily-ENERGY grain only (`pv_kwh` per calendar day) — there
is no stored intraday/instantaneous power series anywhere in this pipeline
to read a literal peak-W value from (the same daily-grain limitation
`anomaly_silence.py`'s own module docstring already had to work around for
3b's "should be producing" window). `docs/design-calibration-2026-08.md`'s
own "Peak W/kWp" capability test (§2/§8) was computed from raw 1-minute CSV
exports that simply do not exist for VRM-API-sourced sites in this schema.
What `check_underperformance()` actually does instead: within the recent
14-day window, pick the day with the HIGHEST day-level PR (`pv_kwh[d] /
(pvgis_expected_kwh_kwp_that_month * pv_kwp)`) — i.e. this site's best real
showing recently, the same "capability, not curtailed/cloudy average"
spirit Phase 11's own peak-W/kWp discriminator was chasing ("*Mean* PR mixes
in curtailment and dead days," docs/design-calibration-2026-08.md line 52)
— and compares THAT single best day's PR against a threshold. This is a
genuine, real proxy for "capability," not the same statistic Phase 11 used,
and its absolute threshold is calibrated separately (see
`_UNDERPERFORMANCE_PR_THRESHOLD` below) — not assumed transferable from
Phase 11's own W/kWp-based cutoffs. Building a literal intraday peak-power
history would need this pipeline to start storing sub-daily VRM data
somewhere, which is new capability, not something achievable by reading
`energy_daily` differently. Flagged for Oscar per this build's own report,
same as 3b flagged its own window-derivation judgment call.

── Threshold numbers below — starting points, not locked (§7 item 1) ──────
Every constant below was picked deliberately conservative (few false
positives over catching everything) and cross-checked against this
pipeline's own real, hand-verified fleet backtest (this build's own report
has the numbers) — but PLAN_PHASE19_FLEET_P3.md §7 item 1 is explicit that
none of these are locked. Expect a real tuning pass once more of the fleet
has accumulated enough history to exercise them.
