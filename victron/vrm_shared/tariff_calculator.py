Forked, literal duplicate of calculations/tariff_calculator.py (Phase 3 of
the Dimensionador/VRM Monitor split) — victron/savings.py only needs
estimate_bill_crc()/estimate_blended_effective_rate_crc(), but this whole
small file is duplicated rather than trimmed, matching the plan's
shared-module strategy for this file. Dimensionador keeps using its own
calculations/tariff_calculator.py unchanged; a future edit to one copy does
not propagate to the other.

Monthly electricity bill estimator using ARESEP tariff structure.

Formula:
  energy_charge = sum of tiered kWh × rate_crc per tier (T-RE: consumption
                  blocks; T-CO: a single flat rate — see below)
  fixed_charge  = access_charge_crc
  total         = fixed_charge + energy_charge

── Deliberately excludes bomberos, alumbrado público, IVA, and Generación
Distribuida charges (DER/COA/CVG/IOS) -- Oscar's explicit direction
(2026-09-02) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Real CNFL invoices (validated against 6 bills across two customers, one with
a full itemized breakdown for three separate months) confirmed every one of
these is messier than a static tariff table can responsibly hold:

  Bomberos is bracket-dependent, not a flat percentage -- two real customers
    at different consumption levels implied 0.68% and 2.1-2.4% respectively,
    and even the SAME customer's rate moved between months.
  Alumbrado público (confirmed ¢3.02/kWh, apparently CNFL-wide) and IOS
    (Impuesto Otros Servicios, flat monthly) are real charges, but only
    verified for CNFL -- no data for any other distributor.
  COA/CVG (Generación Distribuida access charges) don't scale with kWh and
    are revised by periodic ARESEP resolution: two real bills for the exact
    same 410 kWh had COA of ¢9,085 and ¢14,020, a 54% swing with zero change
    in consumption. DER (Recursos Energéticos Distribuidos) was never
    modeled at all, even before this simplification.
  IVA (13%) itself isn't hard to compute, but it taxes a subtotal built from
    all of the above -- keeping it while stripping everything it was taxing
    would just misprice it differently, not more simply.

Rather than keep chasing partial, CNFL-only, sometimes-contradicted values
for all of this, the formula now estimates only the two components with
real month-to-month stability and (for CNFL, at least) real-invoice
confirmation: the tiered/flat energy rate and the fixed access charge. Every
caller showing this estimate to a client (Grid Zero/Hybrid proposals, the
solar-savings-table skill) must say so -- see their own docstrings/SKILL.md
for the exact disclaimer text to carry through to the client-facing
document. `database/tariffs_db.py`'s `alumbrado_publico_rate_crc`/
`ios_monthly_crc`/`coa_monthly_crc`/`cvg_monthly_crc`/`bomberos_pct`/
`iva_threshold_kwh` columns are left in place as reference data (some of it
real-invoice-confirmed for CNFL) for whenever this gets revisited, but
nothing in this module reads them anymore.

`demand_rate_crc`/`demand_threshold_kw` are the same story for a different
reason: they're ARESEP's real, official T-CO demand-charge structure (see
`aresep/tariff_parser.py`'s docstring), but real invoices show it's never
actually billed to Pauly & Co's typical <100kW single-phase commercial
client, so this module ignores them too. `access_charge_crc`/`tiers` for
T-CO, by contrast, ARE read here, and were deliberately hand-corrected away
from ARESEP's raw published values to match those same invoices -- don't
let a routine ARESEP sync silently overwrite them back (see
pages/05_admin.py's tariff-sync tool).
